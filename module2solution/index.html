        The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)
        is a domesticated canid which has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviours, 
		sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Extensive genetic studies undertaken during the 
		2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago.

        The domestic cat (Latin: Felis catus) or the feral cat (Latin: Felis silvestris catus) is a small, 
        typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or 
        simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.Cats are often 
        valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin.

      <p>
        A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, 
        small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known 
        mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, 
        certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.
