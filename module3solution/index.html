        Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Chicken as a meat has been depicted in 
		Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most common meats available in 
		the Middle Ages. It was eaten over most of the Eastern hemisphere and a number of different kinds
		of chicken such as capons, pullets and hens were eaten. It was one of the basic ingredients in the
		so-called white dish, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and 
		seasoned with spices and sugar.
          </p>
		  <p>
		In the 1800s chicken was more expensive than other meats. Chicken consumption in the United States
		increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken
		overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform 
		encephalopathy (mad cow disease). 
    	  </p>
		  <p>
		Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat than most types of red meat
		when measured as weight percentage.Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated 
		roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast
		contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for 
		the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.

          <p>
        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. Beef can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers.
		Its acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.
          </p>
		  <p>
        Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump 
		steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.) Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef 
		jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or 
		used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten
		include the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the 
		pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where 
		there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles
		of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). 
		Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage 
		casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		Beef from steers and heifers is very similar. According to the most recent National Beef Quality 
		Audit, heifer carcasses had slightly more marbling than steer carcasses, but USDA quality grade 
		was not significantly different. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding 
		varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known 
		as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands,
		or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot 
		(or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein,
		roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

          <p>
        Pork is the culinary name for meat from the domestic pig (Sus domesticus). It is the most commonly 
		consumed meat worldwide,[1] with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC. Pork is eaten 
		both freshly cooked and preserved. Curing extends the shelf life of the pork products. Ham, smoked 
		pork, gammon, bacon and sausage are examples of preserved pork. Charcuterie is the branch of 
		cooking devoted to prepared meat products, many from pork.
          </p>
		  <p>
        Pork is the most popular meat in East and Southeast Asia, and is also very common in the Western 
		world. It is highly prized in Asian cuisines for its fat content and pleasant texture. The religions
		of Judaism and Islam forbid pork consumption; the sale of pork is illegal or severely restricted in
		Israel and certain Muslim countries, especially those with sharia law as part of their constitution.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		Pork is the most widely eaten meat in the world, accounting for about 38% of meat production worldwide.
		Consumption varies widely from place to place. The meat is taboo to eat in the Middle East and most of
		the Muslim world because of Jewish kosher and Islamic Halal dietary restrictions. But pork is widely 
		consumed in East and Southeast Asia, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas and Oceania. As the 
		result, large numbers of pork recipes are developed throughout the world. Feijoada for example, the 
		national dish of Brazil (also served in Portugal), is traditionally prepared with pork trimmings: ears,
		tail and feet.
